<h1> <font face="aqua grotesque"> hey y'all!</font></h1>

<p> <font face="aqua grotesque"> i'm jeff katz, and this is my homepage for digital language arts i. to be quite honest, i have no idea what to stick up here, so... here's a lil poem, and a pleasant picture of a tiny church probably haunted by a spirit who loves to listen to the wind whistle through the tall, tall pines. </p>

haha wow !


i will keep myself safe.

i will step back from the edge of that vulnerable void with this space that disassembles my face,
	makes my smile a cubist study in youth culture.

i will call on the inadvertence of my parents, or my grandparents,
	their muscle memory,
	an instinct to add one more word,
	one more eager remark.
i will call on these to transmute a sense of wide eyes into narrow ones.

i will call on these to remind you that I Am Not Real, Do Not Treat Me As Such.
